I'm Torri--I've been coding for about a year and a half now. I started with an intro Java course for non-majors at my university in the last semester of my undergrad in order to understand my CS-major partner (@stumpbeard) better when he would talk to me about his classes. From there, I started grad school in Linguistics and got a research assistantship that required me to learn Python, which was learn-by-doing process that involved doing small projects on a nightly or weekly basis. Last summer, I took two C++ classes, and now I'm back to Python, but I'm working with a different professor. 

I've done many coding projects, but I didn't figure out that I'd like to delve into coding professionally until recently--hence the lack of a personal GitHub until now.
